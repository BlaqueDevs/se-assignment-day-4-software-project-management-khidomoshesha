## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It works best for projects with clear, fixed requirements and minimal expected changes. The main advantages are structured planning, clear documentation, and easier tracking of progress. However, its disadvantages include inflexibility, high costs of changes, and late-stage testing, which can result in costly fixes if errors are found late.

Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative, flexible approach that delivers work in small increments. It is ideal for projects where requirements evolve, as it allows for continuous feedback and adaptation. Its advantages include faster delivery, customer involvement, and early issue detection. However, its disadvantages include less emphasis on documentation, potential scope creep, and dependency on active stakeholder involvement.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial for:
Projects with evolving requirements – e.g., software development for a startup where user feedback drives frequent changes.
Complex, high-uncertainty projects – e.g., AI-driven applications where continuous testing and learning are needed.
Customer-centric products – e.g., mobile app development with iterative feature releases.
Waterfall is more beneficial for:
Well-defined, stable projects – e.g., construction of a power substation with strict safety and compliance requirements.
Regulatory-heavy projects – e.g., medical device manufacturing, where strict documentation is needed.
Large-scale infrastructure – e.g., national power grid upgrades that follow a strict sequence of tasks.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Requirement Analysis – Define clear, testable requirements.
Code Reviews – Peer review to catch errors early.
Automated Testing – Unit, integration, and regression tests.
Manual Testing – Functional, usability, and exploratory testing.
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Frequent code integration and automated testing.
Bug Tracking & Management – Systematic logging and fixing of defects.
Performance & Security Testing – Ensure efficiency and protection against threats.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validate the product meets user needs.
Documentation & Standardization – Maintain clear coding and testing standards.
**Importance of High Standards**
Reduces Costs – Fixing defects early is cheaper.
Enhances User Experience – Reliable, user-friendly software.
Increases Security – Prevents vulnerabilities.
Improves Maintainability – Clean, structured code is easier to update.
Strengthens Reputation – Builds trust with users and stakeholders.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope ensures clear objectives, deliverables, timelines, and constraints, preventing scope creep and aligning stakeholders, which enhances project planning efficiency.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into manageable sections. It helps by organizing tasks, assigning responsibilities, improving cost estimation, and ensuring better control over project execution.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps ensure efficient resource allocation, timely task completion, risk management, and clear communication among stakeholders. It enhances accountability, progress tracking, and overall project control.
Gantt charts assist by providing a visual timeline of tasks, dependencies, and deadlines. They help identify bottlenecks, track progress, and ensure that all activities align with the project timeline, making adjustments easier when needed.
